              Integrative Bodywork Private Sessions with Stephanie Rhodes
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              Integrative bodywork sessions combine elements of thai bodywork,
              yoga therapy, and Reiki to alleviate pain, shift movement/holding
              patterns and energy flow, and support overall wellness through
              release in the body. Rather than digging in to an issue through
              aggressive deep tissue massage or trigger point release, this work
              gently encourages the body to unwind old habits and re-pattern to
              relieve both acute and chronic issues.

              Human Connection and the Mind Body Experience
            </h5>

            <p>
              I find myself continually driven to understand and support the
              human experience. Personally, I developed this curiosity when
              overcoming adversity and seeing how experiences that led to me
              feel isolated were actually opportunities to connect and rebuild.
              As humans, we celebrate successes, honor milestones, cultivate
              relationships, nurture wounds, grieve losses, face loneliness,
              ride the rollercoaster of hope, manage fear, and feel love. There
              is a range of emotions that arises from these experience that can
              sometimes be intense and overwhelming and can impact us in
              profound ways. And what triggers emotions can be different for
              each of us. While a trigger of anxiety may leave me feeling
              helpless, there is most likely someone else close by, possibly
              even right next to me, whose trigger was completely different yet
              who experiences the same emotion. It’s ironic that a feeling that
              can be so isolating can be so common. Professionally, my curiosity
              guided me to becoming a Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor
              where I began to support others in developing their mental
              wellness and assist them in understanding their needs within the
              contextual factors that shape their world. When a person is only
              identified by their behaviors and symptoms, we miss a larger
              picture of understanding that person within these dimensions, or
              areas of intersectionality, that contribute to who they are. In
              addition to considering a person’s DNA, temperament and
              pre-dispositions (“nature”), it is important to consider a
              person’s experiences as well (“nurture”). But we don’t just look
              at a person’s childhood to understand how the person has become
              who s/he is today. Categories such as race, gender, ethnicity,
              education, sexuality, ability, age, migration status, class,
              language and culture, can assist in understanding how these
              interwoven factors impact all of us. While these factors identify
              our differences, they can also help to soften our judgment of
              others and help us to acknowledge the aspects of the human
              experience that are universal and can bond us together. We don’t
              have to have the same events happen in each of our lives in order
              to understand or support each other. When we judge a person based
              on a select behavior, observation or interaction, we miss the
              opportunity to understand that person. I may be distracted in a
              yoga class by a student tapping her hand repeatedly on the mat
              next to me. My mind may initially go to a place of superficial
              judgment (“she’s so annoying and isn’t considering others around
              her”) that only agitates me more and creates a separation between
              myself and my fellow yogini. Did you know that restlessness can be
              related to ADHD? What if I told you that it’s also a possible
              symptom of anxiety? Did you know it could be indicative of trauma?
              Or what if someone is just having a really bad day and is
              preoccupied with an unhelpful thought or feeling? Maybe the
              student is musically inclined and is loving the class playlist!
              Had you considered any of those factors before judging an entire
              person based on one moment? It is an incredibly challenging
              process to stop an initial judgment and consider the contextual
              factors of a person. When we judge, we isolate. When we stop to
              understand, we have the opportunity to become inclusive, caring
              and kind with ourselves and with others. Yoga helped me to bridge
              my personal and professional experiences and find deeper meaning
              both on and off the mat. I learned that there is a difference
              between knowing and doing. An instructor can simply direct
              students to let go of unhelpful feelings, think positive thoughts,
              or breathe deeply, but has anyone acknowledged that this is a
              lofty task?!?! Sometimes there are days where we perseverate, hold
              onto stressful situations, and engage in negative self-talk.
              Sometimes, for a range of physical, mental or emotional reasons,
              it is hard to take a deep breath. This has the potential to stifle
              a practice and be discouraging for a yogi. Sometimes having a
              “just do it” attitude can be empowering and gives perspective when
              excuses and avoidable barriers get in the way of progress. On the
              other hand, sometimes taking time to recognize and acknowledge the
              barriers can assist in overcoming these challenges. I’d like to
              inspire the community by bringing to light the experiences that
              have the tendency to isolate with the opportunity to connect. What
              if it’s possible to feel a little less lonely knowing that others
              are experiencing the same range of human experiences. And what if
              the added awareness could be a small addition to our growth as
              individuals and as a community in a meaningful way. Several years
              ago, I received valuable feedback at a time when I wasn’t
              performing to the expectations of my job or really myself. The
              feedback was: you make the time for what’s important to you. I was
              forced to confront the common excuse of not having time and the
              idea that there is a difference between what is urgent and what is
              important. It’s easy to mindlessly fall into the pattern of
              addressing what is urgent and in your face. There are the reactive
              “fires” we put out that leave our body and mind in a heightened
              state of arousal. We tend to give ourselves the minimum amount of
              recovery time before jumping in to fight the next fire or flee
              from the next overwhelming obstacle, or freeze in the face of
              danger. This is when the emotional part of our brain is overworked
              and the rational thought part of our brain goes into hibernation.
              What that leaves us with is the decreased ability to think
              rationally and problem solve effectively. So how does yoga fit in
              to all of this? When we can develop our physiological awareness,
              we can train our body to self-soothe and de-escalate when
              triggered. In doing so, we calm the overactive emotional brain and
              put it in balance with the cognitive part of our brain in order to
              achieve an equilibrium and more clearly see what’s important to
              us. There are postures that can support this de-escalation of
              arousal when activated. Conversely, there are postures to activate
              when our responses include unnecessary and unhelpful disconnecting
              and slowing. We can train our body using breath and asanas to have
              an impact on our brain which affects our overall physical health,
              mental wellness and behavioral functioning. Join me on June 3rd
              from 7-9pm to learn more about mindfulness and the mind-body
              connection. Come with any range of a subtle curiosity to a full
              open heart to explore how these concepts are impacting you, and
              how you can use them both on and off your mat. About Alison White:

              What led you to become a Barre instructor? Growing up I was always
              into athletics (really just any way to move my body!) and breaking
              a daily sweat. Whether it was running 35+ miles a week for
              cross-country or sprinting over hurdles on a track, I wanted to
              get moving. This amount of mileage and stress at a young age
              unfortunately led to three bulging and rotated discs in my back by
              the age of 16. Luckily enough for me, this also led me to test out
              my first Pilates Class. Continue reading »

              that’s not something you’d expect to hear from a yoga instructor,
              but stay with me. When I first started taking yoga, it was all
              about achieving the best pose, pushing myself, and “mastering”
              yoga. It’s taken me several years, but my yoga journey has taught

              Meaningful Connections. Connecting with people is something I
              aspire to do every day; in doing so aids me in learning more about
              others but ultimately learning more about myself. The connections
              you make with others can sometimes bring a whole new experience to
              your life. New connections can aid you in your personal journey,
              the journey to Self. Continue reading »

              (start with either right or left leg) Right leg: Lay down on your
              left side. Bring your left hand under your left ear to rest the
              weight of your head, OR lay your left arm flat to the mat and your
              head may rest on your left arm. Bring both legs up into a chair
              position on the mat. Make sure your shoulders stack over your
              hips, and your hips are in line with both knees. Bring your right
              hand to the mat in front of your chest to use as leverage once the
              exercise begins. Keep your knees in line, as you draw your right
              leg (top leg) straight (knee over knee). Rotate this foot so your
              toes point down towards the floor and your heel rotates up towards
              the ceiling. Keep this foot flexed. Exercises in this pose:
              isometric holds, pulses, point the toe and draw circles in both
              directions.

              What led you to become a Yoga instructor? · I always knew I’d
              eventually find my way into the health/fitness industry. From my
              childhood through my adolescent years, I was dancing, cheering,
              swimming, or playing lacrosse. I was always sharing the best new
              workout fads with friends and family and from an early age I
              always knew I had a passion to teach. The past 5 years I have
              actively practiced yoga to increase my strength, stability and
              balance. After years of playing high impact sports, such as
              lacrosse, I find that both yoga and barre are still challenging
              but much kinder to my body. Continue reading »

              What led you to become a Barre Instructor: I’ve always had a
              passion for group fitness classes, especially HIIT Burn and TABATA
              classes. When I got my cert in Barre I thought it would be great
              to incorporate my ACE personal training experience and group
              fitness classes with BARRE. One day I just walked into M POWER
              studio and asked the Owner Jason Herd for a chance! He set me up
              for a demo with the manager Michelle and here I am! I love
              teaching Barre at M Power because they allow us to have creativity
              with each class we teach. Most studios make you follow a
              choreograph for months, but M Power allows each instructor to
              bring something different to the table with their classes.

              Why? I spend most of my day in pursuit of the answer to this
              question. Innate curiosity urges me to question and analyze
              everything. I want to know why people behave the way they do and
              then my brain wants to dissect it to find patterns. It might seem
              contradictory to the way of yoga. Yoga is a discipline that asks
              us to clear our minds and be present for our experience. Many
              times with the worthy goal of calming the fluctuations of the
              mind, I have tried to deny that persistent questioning and
              analysis. I have tried to plug up the channels in my mind that
              lead me to always ask, why. For me, this leads to failure,
              insecurity, and yet another why question: why can’t I just let
              things be? Continue reading »

              Yoga Teacher Training. I actually did not think that I wanted to
              teach yoga when I first started the training. It wasn’t until we
              started teaching each other, and then taught our beginner yogi
              friends, that I became inspired to teach yoga. Continue reading »

              For more than just safety reasons, I believe ‘mindful movement’ is
              one of the most integral things you can focus on to grow your
              practice. To me, mindful movement is what takes place in-between
              each posture as well as the adjustments we make once in a posture
              and it is facilitated by the breath. Continue reading

              What led you to become a yoga instructor? My yoga practice became
              consistent after a hip injury that required me to take around 8
              months off of any activity. Yoga is what I credit for healing my
              body, but what I didn’t anticipate was a flooding of other things
              in my life that weren’t healed, specifically processing the loss
              of my mom to breast cancer when I was 15. My desire to share this
              practice with others was building and I, specifically, wanted to
              bring it to breast cancer survivors as healing is yearned for both
              physically and emotionally. Continue reading »

              and life stories for a few hours. MPower wasn’t open yet, in fact
              I think construction had just begun. But Jason took a chance on me
              and after interviewing with him and Michelle, they offered me a
              teaching position. Talk about a meaningful connection. Continue

             What led you to become a yoga instructor?
I believe that yoga was brought to me.  I was in a sad confusing place in my life and came across a postcard to try power vinyasa.  It felt like a calling, so I went for it.  A few months into my new hot practice, the teacher announced a teacher training – my heart dropped in utter fear so I knew in that moment I had to sign up.  My life changed – empowerment through vulnerability – I am so grateful and so blessed to pass on this ancient practice.

              What led you to become a yoga instructor?
At the end of my 25th year, I was spending a lot of time on my mat. I was unhappy in a lot of areas of life, but also actively making changes towards improving for the first time I could ever recall. I had been interviewing for my “dream job”, and bombed in the home stretch; as I laid in Savasana bawling my eyes out, I realized that yoga was the one area of my life that made me feel ALIVE, and I needed more of it. I decided on a 200-hr training in Costa Rica mainly to deepen my practice, and wasn’t sure I’d ever teach, but after about six months back in Baltimore, my real “dream job” started showing up everywhere in my life… And here I am.

              What led you to become a yoga instructor?
I was experiencing some depression and decided I needed to find a spiritual path.  Growing up I never went to church regularly so spirituality was missing from my life.  As my training progressed I discovered all of the wonderful things yoga can do for the mind AND the body.  I think most people go into yoga for the physical benefits but grow in the opposite direction.

              The speed at which we live our lives puts our brain into a high gear: we tend to make decisions and movements in life without clear intention. Much of the time we go through the motions and they don’t have a lot of meaning.  This spans from our physical actions (changing the radio station, eating a meal, folding laundry), to our words (conversations between family, friends and co-workers), to our inner dialogue (the thoughts that move through our head).

              What led you to become a yoga instructor?

I use to live a VERY intense life. I was a trader at the Chicago Board of Trade and was boxing with a boxing coach three times a week. The repetitive movement of hitting the bags and my opponents lead to over use of my shoulder ligaments. Like over used rubber bands the elasticity in my shoulders were shot. The doctors thought it was the end of my workout career and a double surgery was a part of my future. I used yoga to rehab my shoulders and never needed surgery. I was addicted right from the start.
