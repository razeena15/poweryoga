              Integrative Bodywork Private Sessions with Stephanie Rhodes
            </h5>

              Integrative bodywork sessions combine elements of thai bodywork,
              yoga therapy, and Reiki to alleviate pain, shift movement/holding
              patterns and energy flow, and support overall wellness through
              release in the body. Rather than digging in to an issue through
              aggressive deep tissue massage or trigger point release, this work
              gently encourages the body to unwind old habits and re-pattern to
              relieve both acute and chronic issues.

              I find myself continually driven to understand and support the
              human experience. Personally, I developed this curiosity when
              overcoming adversity and seeing how experiences that led to me
              feel isolated were actually opportunities to connect and rebuild.
              As humans, we celebrate successes, honor milestones, cultivate
              relationships, nurture wounds, grieve losses, face loneliness,
              ride the rollercoaster of hope, manage fear, and feel love. There
              is a range of emotions that arises from these experience that can
              sometimes be intense and overwhelming and can impact us in
              profound ways. And what triggers emotions can be different for
              each of us. While a trigger of anxiety may leave me feeling
              helpless, there is most likely someone else close by, possibly
              even right next to me, whose trigger was completely different yet
              who experiences the same emotion. It’s ironic that a feeling that
              can be so isolating can be so common. Professionally, my curiosity
              guided me to becoming a Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor
              where I began to support others in developing their mental
              wellness and assist them in understanding their needs within the
              contextual factors that shape their world. When a person is only
              identified by their behaviors and symptoms, we miss a larger
              picture of understanding that person within these dimensions, or
              areas of intersectionality, that contribute to who they are. In
              addition to considering a person’s DNA, temperament and
              pre-dispositions (“nature”), it is important to consider a
              person’s experiences as well (“nurture”). But we don’t just look
              at a person’s childhood to understand how the person has become
              who s/he is today. Categories such as race, gender, ethnicity,
              education, sexuality, ability, age, migration status, class,
              language and culture, can assist in understanding how these
              interwoven factors impact all of us. While these factors identify
              our differences, they can also help to soften our judgment of
              others and help us to acknowledge the aspects of the human
              experience that are universal and can bond us together. We don’t
              have to have the same events happen in each of our lives in order
              to understand or support each other. When we judge a person based
              on a select behavior, observation or interaction, we miss the
              opportunity to understand that person. I may be distracted in a
              yoga class by a student tapping her hand repeatedly on the mat
              next to me. My mind may initially go to a place of superficial
              judgment (“she’s so annoying and isn’t considering others around
              her”) that only agitates me more and creates a separation between
              myself and my fellow yogini. Did you know that restlessness can be
              related to ADHD? What if I told you that it’s also a possible
              symptom of anxiety? Did you know it could be indicative of trauma?
              Or what if someone is just having a really bad day and is
              preoccupied with an unhelpful thought or feeling? Maybe the
              student is musically inclined and is loving the class playlist!
              Had you considered any of those factors before judging an entire
              person based on one moment? It is an incredibly challenging
              process to stop an initial judgment and consider the contextual
              factors of a person. When we judge, we isolate. When we stop to
              understand, we have the opportunity to become inclusive, caring
              and kind with ourselves and with others. Yoga helped me to bridge
              my personal and professional experiences and find deeper meaning
              both on and off the mat. I learned that there is a difference
              between knowing and doing. An instructor can simply direct
              students to let go of unhelpful feelings, think positive thoughts,
              or breathe deeply, but has anyone acknowledged that this is a
              lofty task?!?! Sometimes there are days where we perseverate, hold
              onto stressful situations, and engage in negative self-talk.
              Sometimes, for a range of physical, mental or emotional reasons,
              it is hard to take a deep breath. This has the potential to stifle
              a practice and be discouraging for a yogi. Sometimes having a
              “just do it” attitude can be empowering and gives perspective when
              excuses and avoidable barriers get in the way of progress. On the
              other hand, sometimes taking time to recognize and acknowledge the
              barriers can assist in overcoming these challenges. I’d like to
              inspire the community by bringing to light the experiences that
              have the tendency to isolate with the opportunity to connect. What
              if it’s possible to feel a little less lonely knowing that others
              are experiencing the same range of human experiences. And what if
              the added awareness could be a small addition to our growth as
              individuals and as a community in a meaningful way. Several years
              ago, I received valuable feedback at a time when I wasn’t
              performing to the expectations of my job or really myself. The
              feedback was: you make the time for what’s important to you. I was
              forced to confront the common excuse of not having time and the
              idea that there is a difference between what is urgent and what is
              important. It’s easy to mindlessly fall into the pattern of
              addressing what is urgent and in your face. There are the reactive
              “fires” we put out that leave our body and mind in a heightened
              state of arousal. We tend to give ourselves the minimum amount of
              recovery time before jumping in to fight the next fire or flee
              from the next overwhelming obstacle, or freeze in the face of
              danger. This is when the emotional part of our brain is overworked
              and the rational thought part of our brain goes into hibernation.
              What that leaves us with is the decreased ability to think
              rationally and problem solve effectively. So how does yoga fit in
              to all of this? When we can develop our physiological awareness,
              we can train our body to self-soothe and de-escalate when
              triggered. In doing so, we calm the overactive emotional brain and
              put it in balance with the cognitive part of our brain in order to
              achieve an equilibrium and more clearly see what’s important to
              us. There are postures that can support this de-escalation of
              arousal when activated. Conversely, there are postures to activate
              when our responses include unnecessary and unhelpful disconnecting
              and slowing. We can train our body using breath and asanas to have
              an impact on our brain which affects our overall physical health,
              mental wellness and behavioral functioning. Join me on June 3rd
              from 7-9pm to learn more about mindfulness and the mind-body
              connection. Come with any range of a subtle curiosity to a full
              open heart to explore how these concepts are impacting you, and
              how you can use them both on and off your mat. About Alison White:

            <p class="card-text">Integrative bodywork sessions combine elements of thai bodywork, yoga therapy, and Reiki to alleviate pain, shift movement/holding patterns and energy flow, and support overall wellness through release in the body. Rather than digging in to an issue through aggressive deep tissue massage or trigger point release, this work gently encourages the body to unwind old habits and re-pattern to relieve both acute and chronic issues. </p>
